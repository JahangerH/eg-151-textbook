# Experiment 2: Digital Input {#sec-lab-2}

All the program examples in [Experiment 1](../lab01) dealt with digital output,
and we learned how to set the bits in the Data Direction Register (DDR) to
make designated ports work as outputs. In Experiment 2 we shall look at
digital inputs.

| DDRC7 | DDRC6 | DDRC5 | DDRC4 | DDRC3 | DDRC2 | DDRC1 | DDRC0 |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
: DDR for setting six outputs {#tbl-1-ddr-inputs}

Referring to @tbl-1-ddr-inputs, the bits set to logic "1" in `DDRC` correspond to physical ports set as outputs. 

**Question**: *What about the bits set to logic "0"?*

***Answer***: The physical ports are inputs, and can be connected to devices outside
the microcontroller, for example switches and sensors.

**Question**: *How is the logic state of a port accessed by the microcontroller?*

***Answer***: By reading from the corresponding port number. The ports on our Nano board are a maximum of 8 bits wide, so a read from the port returns a value
between 0 and 255 ($2^8 - 1$).

**Question**: *Supposing there are several digital inputs on a particular port. How can
we distinguish between one input and another?*

***Answer:*** *There are several ways of
doing this, but they are all based on the idea of masking.*

In the
following example, imagine that there is a physical switch connected to
Port C, bit 7. A read from Port C returns the state of all the bits from
0 to 7. In order to isolate just bit 7, we use a mask and a decision.

| **Value read from Port** | 0 or 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
|--------------------------|--------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Mask** | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  |
| **Value AND Mask** | 0 or 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
: Applying a mask to a register to access a particular value {#tbl-2-mask}

The last row of @tbl-2-mask shows the result of an AND operation on the
value read and the mask. So, a decision zero/non-zero will be exclusive
to the bit that was masked.

The Arduino version of "C" includes some commands which allow individual
bits to be interrogated. The mask operation is still there but it is
"behind the scenes".

## Connecting a switch to a port

How do we connect a switch to a port pin? There are various
possibilities as shown in @fig-ex2-1.

![](pictures/switch_to_port_connections.png){fig-alt="Illustration of the three ways to connect a switch to a port."}

Three ways to connect a switch to a port.
:::

Option "A" looks good, but there are several problems. It requires a
"change over" switch, with connections to both contacts. In addition,
when the switch is in motion from "0" to "1" there is a brief period
when the port voltage is undefined, which can result in unpredictable
operation. For example, it could be seen as multiple operations of the
switch.

Option "B" is much better. It only requires a "single pole" switch,
which is the usual configuration for a keyboard. In addition, the
voltage on the port is always defined; logic "0" when the switch is
open, logic "1" when it is closed.

Option "C" has the same advantages as option "B", though of course the
switch action is reversed -- logic "1" when the switch is open, logic
"0" when the switch is closed. Historically, switch inputs on digital
circuits tend to be of this type, which is known as "active low"
switching. In fact, this option is supported by the internal hardware of
the microcontroller, which has built-in resistors so all that is
required is an external switch connected between the port and logic "0".

This is the case for the hardware that we are using and is illustrated in @fig-ex2-2.

![](pictures/active_low_switching.png){fig-alt="Connecting a switch to a microcontroller."}

Active low switching for a microcontroller.
:::

Each port has an associated pull-up register, which allows individual
bits of the port to be "tied" to logic "1" through a high-value
resistor. Different families of microcontrollers have different
mechanisms for achieving this. In the demonstration programthat
follows, the input pull-up resistors are enabled by a Arduino specific
instruction, `pinMode().` Another microcontroller used in our
undergraduate labs, the "AW60", has special registers called "pull-up
enable" registers to perform the same task.

## Using a switch in a programme

The demonstration program illustrated as a flow-chart in @fig-lab2-flow-chart 
in @lst-ex2-1 is, in fact, the very first
program we tried in Experiment 1. There is one refinement; a switch is
tested and if the logic input is "0", the counter does not advance.
Notice the `pinMode()` instruction in `setup()`, which turns on the internal
pull-up resistor. This is a one-off instruction at the start of
program execution.

Create an Arduino sketch, and copy/paste the code from @lst-ex2-1 into
it.

The testing of the switch input could be done using an Arduino-specific
instruction, `digitalRead()`, but for the sake of completeness here is
how it can be done using a port read and a logical "and" operation. The
designated port is port D, bit 2. Note the use of the exclamation mark
("!"); "!=" means "does not equal".

```c
if ((PIND & 0b00000100) != 0) { 
  counter2++; 
}
```

This will work with a wide range of different microcontrollers and "C"
compilers. Note the use of the ampersand ("&") which is the logical
"and" operation. The equivalent using an Arduino specific command is as
follows:

```c
if ( digitalRead(2) != 0 ) {
    counter2++;
}
```

The argument of the `digitalRead() `operation, 2, is part of the
"shorthand" used by Arduino programmers to designate a particular port
pin. It has the advantage of being consistent over a wide range of
boards in the Arduino family.

Add the two push button switches to the plug-in breadboard, using
pin-to-pin leads ans shown in @fig-ex2-3. Take great care when mounting the switches on the
breadboard, to orient them correctly, and to avoid bending the little
tabs!

When the program runs, the LEDs on Port C will count up as before.
When the left-hand button is pressed, the counter stops and resumes when
the button is released. We are "in control" of the counter!

## Let's go faster

The next program, in @lst-ex2-2, uses both buttons. The left-hand
button, as before, stops the counter. The right-hand button is a "turbo"
button, and makes the counter speed up by a factor of 10! 

A new program structure, `if...else` has been introduced @lst-ex2-2 (lines 28&mdash;33) is used to decide on a delay of 1000 ms
or a delay of 100 ms, depending on the condition of the button.

The general `ifâ€¦else` structure is as follows:

```c
if (condition 1) {
    operation 1
} else {
   operation 2
}
```

An additional program structure, `else if`, can replace `else` if there
are multiple decisions.

## An exercise for the reader... {#sec-section-5}

The last part of Experiment 2 is an exercise for the reader. Do not
despair, all the program elements needed have been covered in this
Experiment and Experiment 1.

Modify the program in @lst-ex2-2 so that the buttons have this
effect:

1.  If no buttons are pressed, a counter on Port C and a counter on Port
    B increment at the same rate, with a delay of 1000 ms so that the
    LEDs seem to be counting identically.
2.  If the left button is pressed, the LEDs on Port C stop counting but
    the LEDs on Port B continue as before.
3.  If the right button is pressed, the LEDs on Port B stop counting but
    the LEDs on Port C continue as before.
4.  If both buttons are pressed, both sets of LEDs stop counting but
    resume when the buttons are released.

*A hint*: there are four distinct parts inside `loop()`; first of all,
update both sets of LEDs. Then test one button and make a decision to
increment counter 1 or not. Then test the other button and do the same
for counter 2. Finally, adjust the delay.

### Wokwi simulation of binary counter with stop/start control

You can run a [**wokwi**](https://wokwi.com) simulation of this circuit which was created by EEE project student Yousef Alsayegh (class of 2024-2025). The link is [Lab 2: Binary counter with stop/start control](https://wokwi.com/projects/413613900477042689) and it uses the code from @lst-ex2-1. You can copy and edit this to create your own simulation the binary counter with stop/start and turbo button using the code from @lst-ex2-2. 

If you do, it would be useful to provide links to the simulations in your lab diary.
