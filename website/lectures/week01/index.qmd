## Introduction {.unnumbered #week1:intro}

In this week's lecture, you will be given an introduction to microcontrollers focusing on what a microcontroller is, where they can be found and how they can be described using the their *architecture*. The lecture then moves on to introduce the Atmel ATmega328 microcontroller, which will be used in the practical sessions in this course, looking at its core architecture including the function of the arithmetic logic unit and registers.

A microntroller is a compact integrated circuit designed to govern a specific operation or set of operations within an embedded system.

At a high level of abstraction, a microntroller includes three core components within a single chip:

- A central processing unit (CPU)
- Memory, and
- Input/output (I/0) peripherals

#### Number of Bits

::: {#fig-nbits}

![](pictures/nbits.png){fig-alt="Architecture diagram showing number of bits used in a microcontroller"}

Architecture diagram showing number of bits used in a microcontroller
:::

::: {.notes}
Categorizing Microcontroller Units (MCUs) as 8-, 16-, or 32-bit designs is one way of classifying their performance capabilities.

The number of bits identifies the size of the registers, the number of available memory addresses and the largest number that can be processed/represented.

As an example, in an 8-bit MCU

- Each register is 8-bits (or one byte) wide. 
- There are $2^8$ (or 256) possible memory addresses
- There are $2^8$ integers that can be represented (0 to 255).

Microcontrollers with more bits, for example 16- and 32-bit MCUs have correspondingly more bits per register, more available memory addresses, and can handle larger numbers compared with their 8-bit counterparts.

An introduction to data representation follows in [Introduction to Data Representation](../data_representation).
:::

Venn diagram of the applications of the 8-bit MCU vs. the 32-bit MCU[^note_venn] 
:::

::: {.notes} 
The plotting of the application benefits of the 8-bit MCU vs. the 32-bit MCU is best plotted on a Venn diagram as direct comparisons of all features combined are relative to tradeoffs. In general, the 8-bit MCU has been lower cost and smaller in size than the 32-bit MCU, but 32-bit MCUs are close to competing on cost and both have at least one “specimen” of a similarly minute physical size. In overall power consumption, the slower 8-bit MCUs will always trump the faster 32-bit MCUs as long as manufacturers stay on their game.

##### Embedded vs external memory{.unnumbered}

Memory in modern microcontrollers can be classified as *embedded* or *external* dependent on whether this is physically located within the MCU itself or is connected separately.

::: {.notes}
For most microcontroller-based applications, the internal memory is enough. However, applications which gather or buffer large amounts of data may also need external memory in the form of SD cards, M.2 drives and similar.

A Raspberry Pi 4 Model B is illustrated in @fig-raspberrypi4b. It has both internal and external memory.

##### Volatile vs non-volatile embedded memory

Broadly speaking embedded memory that is found in a microcontroller can be classified into two categories: 

::: {.incremental}
- *Volatile*: data is lost when power is removed &ndash; this is *temporary storage*.
- *Non-volatile*: data is retained when power is removed &ndash; this is *permanent storage*.
:::

---

Volatile and non-volatile memory can be further classified as illustrated in @fig-vol-non-vol-memory.

#### Instruction Set Architectures

::: {fig-instruction_set}
![](pictures/instruction_set.png){fig-alt="Architecture diagram showing instruction sets used in microcontrollers"}

Architecture diagram showing instruction sets used in microcontrollers
:::

::: {.notes}
The instruction set architecture (ISA) describes the format and operation of instructions the microcontroller can perform and a microcontroller will often be categorized as having a RISC based or CISC based architecture.
:::

---

::: {.fragment}
##### Reduced instruction Set Computer (RISC){.unnumbered}

A RISC is a device with a small, highly optimized set of instructions which utilizes registers and a highly regular instruction pipeline, allowing instructions to be completed in a low number of clock cycles. 

::: {.notes}
In short, several instructions may need to be run to perform a task and this may complicate the coding.
:::
:::

::: {.fragment}
##### Complex Instruction Computer (CISC){.unnumbered}

A CISC is a device in which single instructions can execute several low-level operations or are capable of multi-step operations or addressing modes within single instructions. 

::: {.notes} 
In CISC machines, a program may be easier to read by a human, but the timing will be irregular and difficult to debug or be monitored by a machine.
:::
:::

---- 

##### Example{.unnumbered .smaller}

As an example, consider the case where you want to multiply two numbers stored at addresses 0x0010 and 0x0011 respectively.

::: {.fragment}
On a RISC based architecture microcontroller the code would look something like:

```asm
LDS r18, 0x0010
LDS r19, 0x0011
MUL r18, r19
```
:::

::: {.fragment}
However, on a CISC based architecture machine the multiply instruction may be able to perform the memory access instructions within its execution, meaning the code would look like this:

```asm
MUL 0x0010, 0x0011
```
:::

#### Memory Architectures

:::{#fig-mem-arch} 
![](pictures/mem_arch.png){fig-alt="Architecture diagram showing the memory architectures used in microcontrollers."}"

Architecture diagram showing the memory architectures used in microcontrollers
:::

::: {.notes}
Memory architecture is a different concept from embedded and external and volatile and non-volatile memory. Memory architecture classifications describe where program instructions and data are stored and how they are accessed. 

There are two categories, *Von-Neumann* and *Harvard*.
:::

---

##### Von-Neumann (Princeton) architecture

:::{.notes}
In a Von-Neumann architecture, the same memory and bus are used for both data and instructions used by the CPU and peripherals as illustrated in @fig-week1-vonneuman.
:::

The Von Neumann architecture&mdash;data memory and program code use the same memory storage area and data busses
:::

---

##### Harvard architecture

:::{.notes}
The Harvard architecture stores machine instructions and data in separate memory units that are connected to the CPU and peripherals by different busses as illustrated in @fig-week1-harvard.
:::

::: {#fig-week1-harvard}
![](pictures/harvard_arch.png){fig-alt="The Harvard architecture - data memory and program code use different memory storage areas and busses."}

The Harvard architecture&mdash;data memory and program code use different memory storage areas and busses.
:::

---

##### Modified Harvard architecture

::: {.notes}
Most modern microcontrollers don't have a physical separation between the memory spaces used by data and instructions, and therefore could be described as Von Neumann for this reason. However, since these microcontrollers often use separate busses for data and instructions as illustrated in @fig-week1-modified-harvard, a better way to represent these is as a *modified* Harvard architecture[^l1:note3].
:::

::: {#fig-week1-modified-harvard}
![](pictures/modified_harvard.png){fig-alt="The modified Harvard architecture - data memory and program code use the same memory storage area, but data and program addresses use separate busses to access the memory."}

The Harvard architecture&mdash;data memory and programcode use the same memory storage area, but data and program addresses use separate busses to access the memory.
:::

[^l1:note3]: This gets around the bottleneck that can occur using a Von-Neumann memory architecture with lower costs than having two separate memories.

### How is a Microcontroller Described?

In summary, the final MCU classification shown in @fig-mcu-architecture represents some of categories under microcontroller architecture which are focused around the system itself.

::: {.notes}
There are further classifications as you move towards either the circuit design or the embedded system application.

#### System or Core Architecure

In general, most microcontroller manufacturers will present a system wide, or *core architecture* in the form of a diagram which will appear early on in the data sheet for the device.

##### NXP HCS08 MCU

::: {.notes}
As another example, the block diagram shown in @fig-week1-hcs08 represents the architecture of the NXP (formally Motorola) HCS08 MCU.

This MCU, which was used on this module before the Arduino was adopted, does not have a bank of general purpose registers. Instead it has a single working register, known as the *accumulator*, which is involved in most computations that the MCU performs.

:::

---

#### Arithmetic Logic Unit

##### Operation of the ALU

::: {.incremental}
- First, numbers are read from storage into the ALU's data input ports.

- Once inside the ALU, they're modified by means of an arithmetic or logic operation (`ADD`, `SUB`, `AND`, `OR`...)

- Flags are set in the *Status Register* according to the result of the operation.

- Finally, the data is written back to storage via the ALU's output port.

### Registers

A register is a group of memory bits with special addressing characteristics which is often used for a particular purpose.

::: {.notes}
- In most modern processors, regardless of architecture, data is loaded from a larger memory space into special registers where it is used for arithmetic operations, manipulation or testing by various machine instructions.
- Data is then temporarily held in a register until it is overwritten, or the immediate instruction stores it back to main memory.

#### Registers in the ATMega328 MCU

::: {.notes}
The Atmel ATmega328 is an 8-bit microcontroller and has 256
addressable registers within the user data space. The first 32
locations address the Register File, the next 64 location the standard
I/O memory and then the remaining 160 locations for Extended I/O
memory.

@fig-memmap summarizes the memory map of the ATMega328 MCU. @fig-mem-map2 shows part of the full memory map that is given in the Atmel ATMega280/P data sheet [@atmel_data, pp. 275-280].

#### The Register File

::: {.notes}
The *register file* (see @fig-reg-file) contains 32 x 8-bit wide registers that are often referred to as general purpose or working registers in the CPU.

Each register is also assigned a data memory address, mapping them directly into the first 32 locations of the **user data space**.

Most of the instructions operating on the Register File have direct access to all registers, and most of them are single cycle instructions, however:

- `R0` &ndash; `R15` are not available for all instructions, and

- `R26` &ndash; `R31` have some added functions as pointer registers.

The start address of SRAM is 0x0100, this cannot be accessed with 8-bits (maximum is 0x00FF).

We will look at this in more detail at the end of the module but this approach can be useful to access sets of data where we don't necessarily know the address.
