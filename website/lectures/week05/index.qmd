## Introduction{.unnumbered #sec-week05-intro}

In this lecture we will be looking at two different approaches to reading and writing to ports on a microcontroller. 

::: {.incremental}
- The first approach discussed is using library files and predefined functions to control I/O ports as is conventionally done with the Arduino IDE.
- The second approach will look at accessing I/O bits directly using bit masks to select the desired pins. 
:::




## Lecture topics{.unnumbered}

We begin by looking at digital inputs and outputs before moving onto to show a detailed example program implemented on the Atmel ATmega328 microcontroller.

### Digital Control
Imagine a circuit with LEDs connected to `D8` and `D9` of the Atmel ATmega328 microcontroller.

::: {.fragment}

Both LEDs will be wired to PORTD. How can the LED at `D9` be switched on without changing the state of the LED at `D8`?

:::

::: {.fragment}

The answer is to use the *pin* functions provided by the Arduino library. These functions allow programmers to gain direct access to particular pins

:::

---

::: {.notes}
Using the Arduino IDE, the programmer would first define the pin as an output and then use the `digitalWrite` function to write `HIGH` (integer `0x1`) or `LOW` (integer `0x0`) to the pin as required.
:::

```{.c code-line-numbers="|1-4|1|3|6-11|6|8|9|10|6"}
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  pinMode(9, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  digitalWrite(9, HIGH);
  delay(1000);
  digitalWrite(9, LOW);
}
```

::: {.notes}
This is because for each "sketch" the Arduino IDE automatically includes a the include file  `Arduino.h` and the library file `wiring_digital.c`[^where_to_find].

[^where_to_find]: `Arduino.h` and `wiring_digital.c` are hidden away in the installation folders for the Arduino IDE. The examples versions shown here are taken from the GitHub repository [github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-avr](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-avr).

:::

---

#### The include file Arduino.h

::: {.notes}
Amongst a number of other definitions[^arduino_h], the `Arduino.h` file contains the declarations for the commonly used digital I/O functions: `pinMode`, `digitalWrite` and `digitalRead` (@lst-arduino-h-digital). 
:::

```{.c #lst-arduino-h-digital lst-cap="Declaration of the digital I/O functions for Ardunio hardware (lines 134&ndash;136 of Ardunio.h)"}
void pinMode(uint8_t pin, uint8_t mode);     /* 1 */
void digitalWrite(uint8_t pin, uint8_t val); /* 2 */
int digitalRead(uint8_t pin);                /* 3 */
```
:::{.incremental}
1. `pinMode` takes two *unsigned* 8-bit integers as arguments and has return type of void (returns nothing).
2. `digitalWrite` takes two *unsigned* 8-bit integers as arguments and has return type of void (returns nothing).
3. `digitalRead` takes one *unsigned* 8-bit integer as an argument and returns a *signed* integer value.
:::

::: {.fragment}

[^arduino_h]: To see the full contents see: [Arduino.h](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-avr/blob/master/cores/arduino/Arduino.h) on GitHub.
:::

::: {.notes}

::: {.callout-note}
Remember the function declaration only tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and arguments. 

The actual definition of these functions lies elsewhere in the Arduino core library.
:::

:::

---

#### The library file wiring_digital.c

The [wiring_digital.c](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-avr/blob/master/cores/arduino/wiring_digital.c) file contains the definitions for the `pinMode`, `digitalWrite` and `digitalRead` functions.

See @lst-wk5-pinMode, @lst-wk5-digital-write and @lst-wk5-digital-read for extracts from this library file.

---

##### `pinMode`{.unnumbered}

```{.c #lst-wk5-pinMode lst-cap="Function [pinMode](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-avr/blob/master/cores/arduino/wiring_digital.c#L29) (wiring_digital.c line 29)"}

{
	uint8_t bit = digitalPinToBitMask(pin);
	uint8_t port = digitalPinToPort(pin);
	volatile uint8_t *reg, *out;

	if (port == NOT_A_PIN) return;

	// JWS: can I let the optimizer do this?
	reg = portModeRegister(port);
	out = portOutputRegister(port);

	if (mode == INPUT) { 
		uint8_t oldSREG = SREG;
                cli();

		SREG = oldSREG;
	}
}
```

##### `digitalWrite`{.unnumbered}

```{.c #lst-wk5-digital-write lst-cap="Function [digitalWrite](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-avr/blob/master/cores/arduino/wiring_digital.c#L138) (wiring_digital.c line 138)"}
void digitalWrite(uint8_t pin, uint8_t val)
{
	uint8_t timer = digitalPinToTimer(pin);
	uint8_t bit = digitalPinToBitMask(pin);
	uint8_t port = digitalPinToPort(pin);
	volatile uint8_t *out;

	if (port == NOT_A_PIN) return;

	// If the pin that support PWM output, we need to turn it off
	// before doing a digital write.
	if (timer != NOT_ON_TIMER) turnOffPWM(timer);

	out = portOutputRegister(port);

	uint8_t oldSREG = SREG;
	cli();

	if (val == LOW) {
		*out &= ~bit;
	} else {
		*out |= bit;
	}

	SREG = oldSREG;
}
```

---

##### `digitalRead`{.unnumbered}

```{.c #lst-wk5-digital-read lst-cap="Function [digitalRead](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-avr/blob/master/cores/arduino/wiring_digital.c#L165) (wiring_digital.c line 165)"}
int digitalRead(uint8_t pin)
{
	uint8_t timer = digitalPinToTimer(pin);
	uint8_t bit = digitalPinToBitMask(pin);
	uint8_t port = digitalPinToPort(pin);

	if (port == NOT_A_PIN) return LOW;

	// If the pin that support PWM output, we need to turn it off
	// before getting a digital reading.
	if (timer != NOT_ON_TIMER) turnOffPWM(timer);

	if (*portInputRegister(port) & bit) return HIGH;
	return LOW;
}
```

#### Advantages and disadvantages of using the Arduino IDE

::: {.fragment}
##### Advantages

::: {.incremental}
* Code is cross processor compatible.
* Code is easy to understand.
* Code controls a named pin on the board and is therefore easy to wire up.
* Changing code to use different pins is trivial.
:::
:::

---

##### Disadvantages

::: {.incremental}
* Code is slower than accessing the ports directly.
* You cannot perform multiple bit reads or writes in a single action.

### Logical Bitwise Operators

::: {.notes}
As we saw in [Bitwise logical operators in C](/lectures/week04/#sec-wk4-bitwise-ops) there is a group of operators within the C programming language which are referred to as **bitwise logical operators** (@tbl-bitwise-logic-operators).
:::

::: {.fragment}
| Logical Operation | Operator |
|:------------------|----------|
| AND | `&` |
| OR | `|` |
| XOR | `^` |
| NOT | `~` |
| Shift right | `>>` |
| Shift left | `<<` |
: The bitwise logic operators {#tbl-bitwise-logic-operators} 
:::

::: {.notes}
These are important when working with inputs and outputs as they can be used to apply masks to ports (registers) to work with only specific bits[^io_bits].

[^io_bits]: In the case of I/O specific bits refers to individual I/O pins.
:::

---

### Truth tables for the bitwise logical operators.

The truth tables for bitwise logical operators are given for AND (`&`) in @tbl-truth-table-AND, OR (`|`) in @tbl-truth-table-OR, XOR (`^`) in @tbl-truth-table-XOR, and NOT (`!`) in @tbl-truth-table-NOT.

---

| A | B | `A & B` |
|---|---|:-------:|
| 0 | 0 | 0       |
| 0 | 1 | 0       |
| 1 | 0 | 0       |  
| 1 | 1 | 1       |
: Bitwise AND {#tbl-truth-table-AND}

---

| A | B | `A | B` |
|---|---|:-------:|
| 0 | 0 | 0       |
| 0 | 1 | 1       |
| 1 | 0 | 1       | 
| 1 | 1 | 1       |
: Bitwise OR {#tbl-truth-table-OR}

---

| A | B | `A ^ B` |
|---|---|:-------:|

| 1 | 1 | 0       |
: Bitwise XOR {#tbl-truth-table-XOR}

---

| A | `!A` |
|---|:----:|
| 0 | 1    |

---

### Masking Example

Consider an example where you want to know if bits 0 and 7 are both on / high / logic 1 but you don't care about any other bits. 

::: {.notes}
Programmatically, this would be done using an *if* statement with a bitwise *and* operator:
:::

::: {.fragment}
```{.c code-line-numbers="|1|3|5"}
input = 0b10100011;

if (input & 0b10000001 == 0b10000001 ) 
{
	// do something;
}
```
:::

---

If bits 0 and 7 are `HIGH`

$$
\begin{array}{lcrr}
\mathrm{Bit\ No.}  & & 7654 & 3210 \\\hline
\mathrm{Input}  &    & \mathbf{1}010 & 001\mathbf{1} \\
\mathrm{Mask}   & \& & 1000 & 0001 \\\hline
\mathrm{Result} &    & 1000 & 0001
\end{array}
$$

---

If bits 0 and 7 are `LOW`

$$
\begin{array}{lcrr}
\mathrm{Bit\ No.} & & 7654 & 3210 \\\hline
\mathrm{Input}  &    & \mathbf{0}010 & 001\mathbf{0} \\
\mathrm{Mask}   & \& & 1000 & 0001 \\\hline
\mathrm{Result} &    & 0000 & 0000
\end{array}
$$

::: {.notes}

In both examples, it doesn't matter what bits 1-6 are, they don't affect the result.

:::

---

#### Let us revisit the task

Imagine a circuit with LED’s connected to D8 and D9 of the Atmel ATmega328 microcontroller.


::: {#fig-wk5-arduino-pins-d8-d9}
![](pictures/pins_8_and_9.png){fig-alt="Schematic of Arduino nano board identifying pins D8 and D9."}

Schematic of Arduino nano board identifying pins D8 and D9[^d8_and_d9].
:::

---

How can the LED at `D9` be switched on without changing the state of the LED at `D8`?

[^d8_and_d9]: Pins `D8` and `D9` are respectively bits 0 and 1 of Port B.

---

##### Atmel ATmega328 I/0 Architecture Recap

![](pictures/io_map.png){fig-alt="Arduino ATmega328 Memory map for I/O."}

::: {.notes}

Recall:

Three I/O memory address locations are allocated for each port, one each for the *Data Register* – `PORTx`, *Data Direction Register* – `DDRx`, and the *Port Input Pins* – `PINx`, where `x` refers to the numbering letter for the port (`B`, `C` or `D` in our case).
:::

---

#### Solution with bit masking

Imagine a circuit with LED’s connected to D8 and D9 of the Atmel ATmega328 microcontroller.

::: {.fragment}

How can the LED at `D9` be switched on without changing the state of the LED at `D8`?

:::

::: {.incremental}

* `D8 = PortB0`
* `D9 = PortB1`

:::

---

Let us assume Port B currently reads $1010\,0001$ and we execute[^shortcut]:

```c
PORTB = PORTB | 0b00000010;
```

[^shortcut]: Idiomatic C often uses the shortcut `PORTB |= 0x00000010;` There are many such *assignment operators* in C. For example: `+=`, `-=`, `&=` etc. They all mean the same thing: `var = var op argument`. Internally, the C compiler treats both forms the same so their use is a matter of style. The full version is easier to read and understand. The shortcut is quicker to type, but arguably less easy to read and understand. 

$$
\begin{array}{lrrl}
  & 1010 & 0001 & \mathrm{Port\ B}\\
| & 0000 & 0010 & \mathrm{Bitmask\ for\ D9} \\ \hline
  & 1010 & 00\mathbf{1}1 & \mathrm{D9\ is\ on}
\end{array}
$$

---

To turn the LED on `D9` off, we use the logical AND.

```c
PORTB = PORTB & 0xb11111101;
```

$$
\begin{array}{lrrl}
  & 1010 & 0001 & \mathrm{Port\ B}\\
\& & 1111 & 1101 & \mathrm{Bitmask\ for\ D9} \\ \hline
  & 1010 & 00\mathbf{0}1 & \mathrm{D9\ is\ off}
\end{array}
$$

### Example - breadboard

::: {.notes}
Consider the Ardunino nano circuit shown in @fig-wk5-example-circuit. The left and right push buttons are connected to the digital inputs `D3` and `D2` on the Arduino nano board. These correspond with Port D Bits 3 and 2 on the Atmega328 microcontroller.

:::

---

##### Desired operation {.unnumbered}

::: {.incremental}
- When the left push button is pressed, the red LED (Port B Bit 1) is illuminated.
- When the right push button is pressed, the green LED (Port B Bit 0) illuminated.
- The buttons are digital inputs with pull-up resistors (so *active low*) and are connected to pins 1 and 2 of port D respectively.
:::

::: {.fragment}
What does the code for this look like without using the predefined Arduino functions `pinMode` and `digitalRead`?
:::

---

### Example Code - statement 1

```c
#include <stdint.h>
```

::: {.notes}

`#include` is a **preprocessor directive** used to **include header files** which contain **definitions and declarations** of existing and frequently used functions.

The **<>** variant is used for **system header files** that are included as part of the C language compiler.

 The *stdint.h* header file provides a set of **type definitions (typedefs)** that specify exact-width integer types, together with the defined minimum and maximum allowable values for each type, using macros. The types are tabulated in @tbl-integer-types.
:::

---

### Example code - aligning port names to the I/O memory map {#sec-wk5-align-to-io-mem-map}

The I/O memory map is shown in @fig-wk5-io-mem-map. 

::: {#fig-wk5-io-mem-map}
![](pictures/io_mem_map.png){fig-alt="Memory map for the I/O ports in the Atmel ATmega328."}

Memory map for the I/O ports in the Atmel ATmega328
:::

---

We need to map a port to the address used by the port. We use `#define` for this:

::: {.incremental}
1. Preprocessor directive: `#define`
2. Convenient name that the processor can use in code: `PORTD`
3. The size is an 8 bit unsigned integer: `unit8_t`
4. Memory address of the specific register from the datasheet (reproduced here as @fig-wk5-io-mem-map): `0x2B`.
:::

::: {.fragment}
The full command is[^volatile]:

```c
#define PORTD(*(volatile unint8_t *)(0x2B))
```

[^volatile]: In this definition we use the qualifier volatile to inform the compiler that the variable value can be changed any time without any task given by the source code. Without this qualifier, depending on the optimisation level of the compiler this may result in code that doesn’t work as it doesn’t know the value can be changed by external sources. The asterisk symbol is used to denote a pointer, for now you do not need to know what this explicitly mean but in short a pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location rather than a value.
:::

---

The full set up which sets up the ports, data direction registers and pins is:

```c
//I/O and ADC Register definitions taken from datasheet
#define	PORTD (*(volatile uint8_t *)(0x2B))
#define DDRD  (*(volatile uint8_t *)(0x2A))
#define PIND  (*(volatile uint8_t *)(0x29))

#define PORTB (*(volatile uint8_t *)(0x25))
#define DDRB  (*(volatile uint8_t *)(0x24))
#define PINB  (*(volatile uint8_t *)(0x23))
```

---

### Example Code - the main function{#sec-wk5-main-c}

This is the starting point for any program[^main].

```{.c code-line-numbers="|1|3|4"}
int main (void) 
{
    // code
    return 0;
}
```

::: {.notes}

The return type is declared as integer meaning the function returns some integer even ‘0’ at the end of the program execution. By convention, a return of ‘0’ represents the successful execution of a program.
:::

---

### Example Code - Set data direction registers

::: {#fig-wk5-set-dd-registers}
![](pictures/dd.png){fig-alt="Video illustrating the setting up of the data direction registers."}

::: {#fig-wk5-set-pull-ups}
![](pictures/pullup.png){fig-alt="Video illustrating the setting of the port D for input and resetting port B."}

:::

---

### Example Code - The infinite for loop

The **infinite *for* loop** is quite a common idiom in C:
```{.c code-line-numbers="|1|3"}
for (;;;)
{
   // code that repeats forever
}
```

Any code that is placed inside the for loop will run forever.

::: {.notes}

The Arduino IDE does the same thing behind the scenes - `void loop` is actually a function that is repeatedly called inside an infinite for loop[^main].

[^main]: The actual code is slightly different and if you are interested you can access it here: [main.cpp](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-avr/blob/master/cores/arduino/main.cpp). Note that the sketch function `setup()` is called once first, then `loop()` is called each time through the infinite loop.

```c
int main(void)
{
  setup();
    
  for (;;) {
	  loop();
  }
        
  return 0;
}
```

:::

---

### Example Code - Reading the button

::: {.notes}
This *if* statement is at the heart of the program. Each time though the loop it tests the condition of bit 2 in the `PIND` register (`D3`). The pin linked to this bit has been configured as an input with the pull-up resistor enabled and it has been wired to the left button. This means the default state is 1 (`HIGH`) and pressing the button will ground the input to 0 (`LOW`).

 We then use a bit mask to query bit 2 only, and if the result is zero, we turn on bit 1 of `PORTB` - which illuminates the red LED.
:::

```{.c code-line-numbers="|1|3"}
if ((PIND & 0b00000100) == 0)
{
    PORTB = 0b00000001; // Sets port B, bit 0 to logic 1/high which switches the LED connected to D8 on.
}
```

##### Exercise{.unnumbered}

::: {.fragment}
Similar code is used to test the left button on `PORTD` pin 3 to illuminate the green LED on `PORTB` pin 1. 

See if you can write this code.
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Solution**

```{.c code-line-numbers="|1|3"}
if ((PIND & 0b00001000) == 0)
{
    PORTB = 0b00000010; // Sets port B, bit 1 to logic 1/high which switches the LED connected to D9 on.
}
```

### The full program

The full program is available as a GitHub gist: [main.c](https://gist.github.com/cpjobling/07585093f8eafe69a4eeff1186110883). You will need a fully featured IDE, such as [Microchip Studio](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/develop/microchip-studio), to compile and upload the code to the Ardino nano board.


## Summary{.unnumbered}

In this section we have:

::: {.incremental}
* Begun to look at I/O operations on the Atmel Atmega 328 microcontroller including the registers and checking/setting states based on flow control statements.
* Introduced bit masking to read/write individual bits of a register without affecting the remaining bits.
* Looked at a detailed example program which uses the state of two pushbuttons to set whether an LED is illuminated or not.
