# Appendix A: Other Data Representations

The content of this appendix is intended to expand on what was covered in {ref}`week02`. 

The text is supported by four short videos which present the material and cover additional information and methods about how 
data is represented on a microcontroller; these include, two's complement, binary coded decimal, binary fractions and A.S.C.I.I.

You will find the videos on Canvas on page [Two's complement, BCD, Binary Fractions and A.S.C.I.I](https://canvas.swansea.ac.uk/courses/44971/pages/week-2-twos-complement-bcd-binary-fractions-and-a-dot-s-c-dot-i-i?module_item_id=2285553).
