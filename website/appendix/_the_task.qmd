## The Task {#sec-programming-in-c-1}

### Project Brief {#sec-initial-task}

Using the Arduino Nano board which contains an Atmel ATMega 328 Microcontroller; write a program so that every time a push button is pressed, an analogue signal (such as the output of a sensor) is read and the value of the voltage as a proportion of the maximum voltage displayed on a bank of LEDs.

This task is similar to the task defined for [Experiment 3: Analogue to Digital Conversion](/labs/lab03) but it is tackled in a slightly different way.
