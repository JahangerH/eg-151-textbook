## Project Brief

Using the Arduino Nano board which contains an Atmel ATMega 328 Microcontroller; write a program so that every time a push button is pressed, an analogue signal (such as the output of a sensor) is read and the value of the voltage as a proportion of the maximum voltage displayed on a bank of LEDs.

This task is similar to the task defined for {ref}`lab_3` but it is tackled in a slightly different way.
