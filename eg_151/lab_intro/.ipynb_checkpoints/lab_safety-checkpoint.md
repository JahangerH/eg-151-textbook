# Laboratory Safety

The Faculty of Science of Engineering has a safety document which can be viewed online. The following points are of relevance to the Electronics Laboratory:

* The fire exits are through the main entrance or the connecting door to the adjacent Sports Science laboratory. If the fire alarm sounds, go downstairs to the covered walkway and out of the building by the shortest route. Do not use the lifts. The congregation point is on the seaward side of the building, near the south-eastern corner (Margam Square).
* Coats and bags MUST be kept in the area provided in the laboratory. Any item left on the floor or around the benches constitutes a trip hazard.
* Great care has been taken to prevent electric shock by keeping all voltage sources above 48V away from careless fingers. Do not remove any covers on instruments or experiment hardware.
* You will need to use hand tools and soldering irons from time to time. Take great care to use personal protective equipment, soldering iron stands, and heatproof mats as appropriate.
* Report any accident as soon as possible to one of the demonstrators or technical staff.
