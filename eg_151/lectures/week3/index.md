## Introducing the Atmel ATmega 328 MCU

In {ref}`week1` we described what a microcontroller is and looked at how one can be described by considering its architecture. We finished the lecture looking at {numref}`week3:fig:atmel_arch` which provides an overview of the AVR core architecture and we introduced the general purpose registers and the ALU.
