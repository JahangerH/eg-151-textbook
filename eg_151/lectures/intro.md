## Course Overview

This course is made up of lectures which introduce the basics of microcontroller architecture and operation,and how they are programmed

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

### Course syllabus

Applications of microcontrollers, and programming in both assembly and 'C' languages.The lectures will be supported by a series of practical sessions where you will learn how to implement the lecture content to commission simple programs on an Arduino microcontroller.

+++ {"jp-MarkdownHeadingCollapsed": true, "slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

### Key Topics

-   Microcontroller fundamentals and architecture.

-   Microcontroller programming: instruction execution; basic instructions.

-   Software design and development tools.

-   Assembly and C programming languages,

### Course Assessment

There are four formal assessment components to this course:

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

1.  **Lab introduction exercise** &ndash; 15%

    -   During the first two weeks of term, the laboratory will be used
        for a laboratory introduction exercise covering health and
        safety, a breadboard construction exercise, a simulation
        exercise and a soldering exercise.The laboratory introduction is
        COMPULSORY and must be passed if a student is to work in the
        laboratory.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

2.  **Five short 'C' language programming exercises** &ndash; 20% (4% each)

    -   An example program will be provided which students are expected
        to modify so as it performs the required functions. The 4
        exercises involve creating a binary counter, reading a digital
        input, reading an analogue input and working with arrays.
        Assessment will be through submission of a lab diary containing
        the modified and commented code, a flow chart and a description
        of the changes made. Submission will be through the Turnitin
        platform.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

3.  **A mini project** &ndash; 30%

    -   The mini project will require each student to create a program
        to achieve a certain task making use of the knowledge gained
        during the lectures and four lab exercises. Assessment will be
        through submission of a lab diary containing the modified and
        commented code, a flow chart and a description of the changes
        made. Submission will be through the Turnitin platform.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

4.  **Formal Class Test**  &ndash; 35%

    -   The class test will be online and based on content covered in the
        lectures and laboratory sessions.These questions will be similar
        to those presented in each weekly quiz. For the practical
        assessment marks to count, you must achieve at least 30% in the
        Formal Test.You will have one attempt to redeem a failure before
        the end of semester 1. If you achieve less than 30% after this,
        then the course mark will be just the Class Test mark and you
        will be required to sit a supplementary exam in August.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

**Additionally, to pass this course you must achieve at least 40% in each component and have an 80% attendance rate at both lectures and laboratory classes**.
