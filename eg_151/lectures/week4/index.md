```

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "notes"}}

The first version of **Hello, World!** was published in the classic book Kerningham and Ritchie, The C Programming Language, 1st Ed. Prentice Hall, 1978. 

Since then, it has become common to introduce each new programming language with a version of this programme.

Unfortunately, there is a lot of complexity in this simple programme, and it is not easy to run "Hello, World!" on a microcontroller!
