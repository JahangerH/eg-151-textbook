# Course Aims

**EGâ€“151 Microcontrollers** aims to introduce you to laboratory work in Electronic and Electrical Engineering, the fundamentals of microcontroller structure and operation and to help you to develop skills in low-level programming language and project work. 

There will be a lab introduction, an introduction to programming in the embedded C-language, an appreciation of low-level programming with assembly code, and opportunities to apply what you have learned to a simple microcontroller-driven instrumentation project.
