# Experiment 5: LCD Display Panel

+++

## Introduction

Experiment 5 introduces two new concepts. A new piece of hardware, the
alphanumeric liquid crystal display, and a new software structure, the
library.

+++

## Alphanumeric Display module

You will be given an Alphanumeric Display module. This
module can display two lines of 16 characters, using any characters in
the ASCII standard list plus several special characters and up to eight
user-defined characters. The interface to the display module is
straightforward. Characters are written directly to the display and
appear at the cursor position. Command characters can be sent which set
the mode of operation of the display and allow the cursor to be moved
around.

Direct information on this module can be obtained from the [Farnell
website](https://uk.farnell.com/), part number 3759026. Displays of this type are all
based on a complex integrated circuit produced by Hitachi, part number
HD 44780.

One complication of using the alphanumeric display module is the small
number of input-output pins on the Arduino Nano. A special mode of
operation is employed, in which eight-bit data bytes are transferred as
two, four-bit "nibbles". A demonstration programme that is available to
you shows you how numeric values and character strings can be
displayed.

A copy of the data sheet for the
display and a list of ASCII characters]
can be found on [Canvas](https://canvas.swansea.ac.uk/courses/44971/files/4630684?module_item_id=2258159).

There are 18 pins arranged in a straight line, which allows the module
to be plugged into a standard breadboard. The pins are grouped as eight
for data, three for control, and three for power and contrast. A further
four pins (pins 15 to 18) are used to illuminate the RGB "back light".
The functions of the pins are as follows:

**Pin 1**: Ground/Zero Volts

**Pin 2**: Supply positive, typically 5 V.

**Pin 3**: Contrast pin. Connected to a potentiometer to set the display
contrast.

**Pin 4**: Register Select: an address line, selecting either command or
data.

**Pin 5**: Read/Write: logic "0" for writes, logic "1" for reads.

**Pin 6**: Enable: writes a command or data to the display.

**Pins 7 to 14**: Data pins D0 to D7 respectively.

**Pin 15**: +5 V +5V connection for backlight.

**Pins 16 to 18**: zero volts for backlights red, green, blue respectively.

## Library for LCD

Many devices such as the LCD require some complex software. A library,
in this context, refers to additional code which is linked into the main
programme using "#include" and is accessed using specific commands. In
this case, the LCD library is included as follows:

```c
#include <LiquidCrystal.h>
```

Some libraries, such as the SPI and IIC libraries, are present in the
standard version of the Arduino IDE. Other libraries must be added using
"Tools/Manage Libraries" from within the Arduino IDE.

Here are some examples of the extra commands that the library contains:

```c
lcd.setCursor(0, 1);
```

This command moves the cursor of the LCD to the start of the second line
of the display.

```c
lcd.print("hello, world!");
```

In this case, the alphanumeric string, variables, or arithmetic
expression contained within the brackets is printed at the current
cursor position.

The best way to understand how the LCD hardware and software work, is to
build the circuit that follows on plug-in breadboard and to try the
example programme in {ref}`listing9`.

## Functions of the Demonstration Programme

As explained previously, the LCD module is connected in "4-bit mode", to
minimise the number of connections to the Arduino Nano processor. In
addition to the 4 data bits, there are two command signals, Register
Select (RS) and Enable (E). These are the absolute minimum number of
connections between the LCD and the processor. An additional command
signal, Read/Write, (R/W) is connected permanently to logic "0".

There are two potentiometers on the demonstration board. One sets the
contrast of the LCD, which is necessary to adjust the correct balance
between the illuminated and dark pixels. The other potentiometer sets
the voltage on analogue input `A7`.

Two push buttons are provided, connected to digital inputs `D10` and
`D11`. Note the use of `pinmode` in `setup()`, which turns on the
pull-up resistors associated with inputs `D10` and `D11`.

Copy the text of the demonstration programme into a new Arduino sketch,
and compile and upload in the usual way. When the programme is running,
it should display the message "hello world!" on the first line. On the
second line, the first few characters are a count in seconds since the
board was reset. The remainder of the second line shows the message "ADC
= xxxx", where "xxxx" represents a number between 0 and 1023, as
determined by the setting of the potentiometer. Pressing the push
buttons should result in the characters "R" or "L" being displayed near
the end of the first line of the display.

The example code provides examples of how to set the display and write
messages and variables. The example code can form the basis of the
exercise that follows.

## Task for Experiment 5

The exercise for this experiment is to configure the demonstration board
as a bar graph display, similar to the exercise in Experiment 3. But in
this new exercise, the bar graph is not a line of LEDs, it is the top
line of the LCD. There are 16 character positions, so that each "block"
of the bar graph will correspond to 64 values from the ADC (which is 10
bits, so there are 1024 possible values).

Here is the required display. Retain the line "ADC = " followed by the
ADC value displayed on the second line, this will be useful when testing
your programme.

ADC value = 0;        Display = "`                 `" (all spaces)

ADC value = 1-63;     Display = "`#                ` " (only first block)

ADC value = 64-127;   Display = "`##               ` " (first two blocks)

and so on until:

ADC value = 1018-1023 Display = "`#################`" (all 16 blocks)

Â 

The "`#`" character is only here as an example. A more suitable character
is available on the LCD, which corresponds to ASCII code 255 and appears
as a rectangle of 7 by 5 pixels. It can be printed as
follows:

```c
lcd.write(byte(255));
```

There are a number of ways to achieve this programme. One would be to
"trap out" the zero value, and print a line of 16 space characters, then
divide the ADC value by 64 and use this as an index in a character
array.

An alternative would be to write a programme loop which decrements the
scaled ADC value and printing "#" until the result is
zero.

## Assessment of Experiment 5

As with previous exercises, the plug-in breadboard should be
photographed with your student card and added to your laboratory diary.
A listing of your programme should be included, with plenty of comments.
A programme without comments is of only limited value, as nobody else
can follow it!
