# Experiment 3: Analogue to Digital Conversion

## Analogue to Digital Conversion

It has been said many times that we live in a digital world. This is not
true! We live in an analogue world, filled with voltages, currents,
temperatures, pressures &ndash; all quantities which vary continuously and
can be measured with great accuracy. The digital world wants everything
neat and tidy, on or off, hot or cold, zero or one: which is not
necessarily compatible with the analogue world. In order to access
analogue information in a digital system, an Analogue to Digital
Converter (ADC) is needed.

Analogue to Digital Conversion
```

The transfer characteristic of a 10-bit ADC is shown in the {numref}`fig:ex3:1`
above. Let us suppose that the analogue input voltage, Vin, can be
anywhere between zero Volts and Vref. As $V_\mathrm{in}$ increases, the binary
output varies from all zeros when $V_\mathrm{in} = 0$, and all ones when $V_\mathrm{in} = V_\mathrm{ref}$.

Now, the previous statement is only 99.9% true, as will be explained.
Suppose $V_\mathrm{ref} = 5$ V. Then each step shown on the graph above, is
equivalent to $(5\,\mathrm{V} / 1024)$ which is (nearly) 5 mV. So the maximum
voltage that can be measured is not, strictly, $V_\mathrm{ref}$, it is $V_\mathrm{ref}$ minus
one step! In our example, that will be $(5\,\mathrm{V} - 5 \mathrm{mV})$ which is a tiny
fraction over 4.995 V.

The primary characteristic of an ADC is this figure *N*, the number of
bits. It tells us the RESOLUTION of the ADC. Another important
characteristic is the conversion time, which determines how many
conversions can be performed per second.

Some examples of ADCs. Suppose we want an ADC to convert high quality
digital audio signals. Then the minimum value of *N* would be 16, in
order to give an acceptable resolution. With N = 16, there will be 216
steps on the conversion graph, which is 65,536. The conversion speed is
related to the audio bandwidth required. Most computers and tablets use
ADCs which give 48,000 samples per second, which is $22\,\mu\mathrm{s}$ per
conversion. This is a high specification, as it is necessary in order to
produce clean digitised audio with a high bandwidth.

That was the "Rolls-Royce" ADC. Suppose we need an ADC capable of
digitising audio for a telephone line. The bandwidth of the audio signal
on telephone lines is typically 3.5 kHz, and the internationally agreed
conversion speed is 8000 conversions per second, corresponding to 125 us
per conversion. The resolution need only be 8 bits to give acceptable
telephone quality, corresponding to 28 = 256 steps. So the ADC needed
for telephone quality has a much lower specification than the one for
high quality digital audio. We shall not extend the metaphor of the make
of motor car, in case of legal action.

The ADC inputs on our Arduino Nano are 10 bits resolution and can be
sampled at a maximum of about 10 kHz, so they easily meet the
specification for telephone lines on speed and resolution but are a bit
short of the resolution and speed for high quality audio.

## Reading an Analogue Input

The Analogue to Digital Converter on the Arduino Nano has six inputs
which are shared with other functions, and two inputs which are
exclusively analogue inputs. The command to read from an analogue input
is of the form `analogRead()`, where the brackets contain an expression
which specifies the analogue input. Note that the hardware only permits
one conversion at a time, so if we want to read the value from all eight
inputs this will require eight separate `analogRead()` instructions.
This can be an issue if we need to read several voltages simultaneously,
which requires additional hardware external to the Arduino Nano.

If you look in {ref}`listing6`, you will find a simple programme which
repeatedly reads from analogue input 6 (`A6`) and displays the value on
the LEDs. The source of the voltage to be measured is from a
potentiometer, which is a resistor with a moving contact which can be
used to give a fraction of the voltage across the ends. As the wheel on
the potentiometer is rotated, the fraction of the voltage varies from
zero to 100%.

There is a slight problem. There are only six LEDs connected to Port C,
which gives a maximum number of $(2^6 - 1) = 63$. However, the number
read from the ADC has a maximum value of $(2^{10} - 1) = 1023$. So,
as a "cheat", the value of `analogRead()` is divided by 16 so that it
fits!

Modify the plug-in breadboard by adding the supplied potentiometer and
connecting it as shown in {numref}`fig:ex3:2`, using wire links cut from the
supplied single-core cable using the wire cutter and stripper. Don't
forget to wear eye protection when cutting the wires!

Create an Arduino sketch in the usual way and copy the code from
{ref}`listing6` into it. Compile and download the code. When the programme
is running, turn the potentiometer slowly. You will see the LEDs light
up in a binary sequence, so that no LEDs are illuminated when the wheel
is fully anticlockwise, and all the LEDs are illuminated when the wheel
is fully clockwise. Try and find a position where the LEDs change over
from 011111 (31 decimal) to 100000 (32 decimal). This should be exactly
half-way between the extreme positions.

## Bar Graph Display

The next demonstration programme is of a bar graph display. Instead of
illuminating in a binary sequence, the LEDs light progressively from one
end to the other in the same way as the volume indicator on digital
record and playback equipment. The number from the ADC has a maximum
value of 1023, and there are only six LEDs. So the number from the ADC
must be scaled. Let us pretend that 1024/6 = 170.

ADC = 0; no LEDs lit.

ADC = 1 to 170: one LED lit.

ADC = 171 to 341: two LEDs lit.

ADC = 342 to 512: three LEDs lit.

ADC = 513 to 683: four LEDs lit.

ADC = 684 to 853: five LEDs lit.

ADC = 854 to 1023: six LEDs lit.

How are we to make this set of decisions? One solution would be to use a
series of `if()` statements, however some slight additions are needed.
We actually need an` if() â€¦ else` statement, so that only one of the
conditions causes a write to the LEDs. If you look at the programme in
{ref}`listing7`, you will see that it begins its tests with the highest
threshold and progresses down in steps of 170 until zero.

Copy/paste the programme into an Arduino sketch, compile and test. As
you rotate the wheel on the potentiometer clockwise, progressively more
LEDs will light. If you balance the setting so that it is just changing
over from three LEDs to four, this is exactly halfway on the
potentiometer (arrow pointing upwards).

## An Exercise for the Reader

Now that we are familiar with the concept, let us write a programme to
illuminate all twelve LEDs as a bar graph. The following changes will
need to be made to the programme in {ref}`listing7`:

Both Port B and Port C will need to be updated after each
`if() `statement, e.g.

```c
PORTC = 0b00000011; 
PORTB = 0b00111111; 
```

will result in the top two LEDs off, all other LEDs on.

The threshold numbers will go up in steps of $(1024 / 12)$ which is
approximately 85.

Create a new Arduino sketch and modify the programme from {ref}`listing7`.
When you test it, the LEDs should light progressively as the
potentiometer is rotated clockwise. When the potentiometer is at the
extreme anticlockwise position, all LEDs will be out.
