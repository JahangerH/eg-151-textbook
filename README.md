# EG-151 Microcontrollers

This module introduces basic microcontroller structure and operation. It consists of a lecture course on the architecture and operation of the target microcontroller, and a series of laboratories culminating in a miniproject in which students will apply their experience to a simple practical problem.

This branch of the repository is for the development of a version of the website and resources in Quarto.
